# Meta Data Analyst Pet Store Task
Task from the Meta Deta Analyst professional certification on Coursera.

### Project Overview
This data analysis project consists of cleaning, exploring and analyzing product sales data for a pet-food business, later generating an informative dashboard in Tableau to visualize sales data for different product line, and categories.

### Data Sources
The dataset used for this analysis is the provided "transactions-pet_store_small" file, containing 300 entries of detailed sales data.

### Tools:

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handing missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
In the exploratory phase of the data analysis, I asked questions such as:

- What are the total sales for the pet store?
- Which product line (cat, dog) sees the higher sales?
- How do total sales look when seperated into each product category?
- What are the peak sales periods?
